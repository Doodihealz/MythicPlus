## Setup Instructions

## SQL Setup

Run these SQL files on the **appropriate databases**:

| File Name                    | Purpose                                                | Target DB   |

### 2. Lua Scripts
Place in your serverâ€™s Lua scripts folder:
- `Mythic.lua` (this file)
- `MythicBosses.lua` (define dungeon maps, boss IDs, and final boss)

Make sure your `dofile()` points to the correct location:
```lua
dofile(".../MythicBosses.lua")
```

### 3. Keystone NPC (Manual or SQL)
- **NPC Entry**: `900001`
- **Name**: Mythic Advisor  
- **Subname**: The Keystone Exchanger

## Weekly Affix System

Affixes rotate each server restart:

| Tier | Affixes Active |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | 1 Affix        |
| 2    | 2 Affixes      |
| 3    | 3 Affixes      |

Edit `WEEKLY_AFFIX_POOL` to modify or expand the affix set.  
Buffs are applied dynamically to all eligible enemy creatures.

### Affix Tiering System

Affixes are split into three distinct **difficulty tiers**. One affix from each tier is randomly selected at server start:

| Affix Tier | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tier 1     | Low-impact buffs (healing, regen, weak damage or defense)      |
| Tier 2     | Moderate-impact mechanics (high defense or slightly bursty)       |
| Tier 3     | High-impact effects (Hard hitting, Massive hostile npc damage output buff) |

When Mythic+ is activated:

- **Tier 1 keys** apply a Tier 1 affix  
- **Tier 2 keys** apply Tier 1 + Tier 2 affixes  
- **Tier 3 keys** apply all three tiers of affixes  

> Each week's affix set is randomly selected â€” 1 per tier â€” from the defined `WEEKLY_AFFIX_POOL`.

### Affix Tier Table

| Tier | Affix Name         |
|------|--------------------|
| 1    | Rejuvenating       |
| 1    | Demonism           |
| 1    | Resistant          |
|------|--------------------|
| 2    | Turtling           |
| 2    | Priest Empowered   |
| 2    | Falling Stars      |
|------|--------------------|
| 3    | Enrage             |
| 3    | Rallying           |
| 3    | Consecrated        |

---

## Keystone Tiers

| Tier | Keystone Item ID | Affix Count |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| 1    | 900100           | 1           |
| 2    | 900101           | 2           |
| 3    | 900102           | 3           |

Mythic+ is initiated by using a keystone at the NPC.  
Buffs and effects persist through relogs and re-entries.
Some maps have more time than others. It was changed through testing.
Timers are always 15 minute or 30 minutes. Never more never less.

---

## Reward System

| Tier | Reward                            |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| 1    | Emblem of Conquest Ã—1 (45624)     |
| 2    | Emblem of Triumph Ã—1 (47421)      |
| 3    | Emblem of Frost Ã—1 (49426)        |
| 4    | Emblem of Frost Ã—2 (49426)        |

Players receive their next-tier keystone **from the chest** (T1 â†’ T2, T2 â†’ T3).
There's a Horde and Alliance version of the Tier 2 chest (Because ToC loot is faction bound ðŸ˜’)

## Mythic Rating System

- **Starts at**: 0  
- **Caps at**: 2000
- **Progression**:
  - Tier 1: +20 rating
  - Tier 2: +40 rating
  - Tier 3: +60 rating

### Penalties

| Tier | On Death (per) | On Fail (Timeout) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1    | âˆ’3             | âˆ’10               |
| 2    | âˆ’6             | âˆ’20               |
| 3    | âˆ’9             | âˆ’30               |

Rating canâ€™t fall below 0.  
No rewards if the timer expires. All buffs are removed.
